# Contributing to the [ASPeKT] Project

Thanks for visiting, if you're reading this you must be interested in contributing to [ASPeKT], or lost... Let's hope for the first. This is the perfect time to contribute to [ASPeKT]. It's in its infancy, and we're looking for people to drive project direction. [ASPeKT] foundation 
needs direction in real world projects. So if you're looking for an open source AOP library, look no further. Please feel free to make enhancements
as you see fit.

# About Testing

The [ASPeKT] team are huge proponents of unit testing. So along with any enhancements or bug fixes, there is an expectation that it will be tested
to the best of your ability! Unit testing is fun! It also helps to bring great designs to the table. If you're struggling to understand how to test something
please feel free to contact me mvpete@live.ca. I will do everything in my power to help.

# About Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to a project admin. The Pull Request should have the following sections:

## Motivations 
This section should include a small paragraph about the motivating factors behind the PR.

## Modifications 
This should be a small detail on the affected areas and high level code changes required

## Results 
A paragraph on the outcome of the pull request.

When submitting a Pull Request, please ensure all unit tests are passing. This is a barrier for a Pull Request and it will not be reviewed
if any tests are failing.



# About Coding Standards
We follow pretty close to Microsoft's C# Coding Guidelines, so you should easily pick it up, if not just ask. We don't bite! We use a comprehensive set rules in our editorconfig file
and as long as you play by the IDEs rules you should be fine. 

We're abit like the boyscouts around here -- we try to leave things cleaner than when we got there. Originally, when the project was first created
I didn't use coding standards. Then Brant said I should -- I agreed with him. So now we're going about our business cleaning up my mess. I really appreciate that.
